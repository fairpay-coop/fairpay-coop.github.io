<p>Joseph is software architect and social entrepreneur.  As a veteran of the venture capital
  driven San Francisco Bay Area tech scene he passionately believes that there is a better way to
  structure enterprises to best serve customers, workers, and society.  He has found great inspiration
  from the books

  He is saddened by the unnecessary level of transaction fees typically paid out by community serving organizations.
   The desire to help the organizations that he cares about to navigate the convoluted world of
  payment processing is what inspired him to found the Fairpay Cooperative.

<p>
  Fabrice has more than 20 years of experience in software engineering and consulting, working
  with the complete lexicon of software technologies. Renowned for his resourcefulness, Fabrice loves
  nothing more than being told that something cannot be implemented, and then going away for a couple
  of hours and doing it.
</p>
<p>
  When he's not crafting code, Fabrice can be seen rock climbing, riding his bike in the sunny
  streets of Oakland or improving his cooking skills in the kitchen.
