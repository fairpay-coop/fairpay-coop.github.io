<h2>A Different Kind of Enterprise</h2>
<p>
  The FairPay Cooperative is an experiment in building a different kind of enterprise.  Our mission
  is to facilitate the lowest cost and most practical payment solutions for social enterprises, non-profit
  organizations, and community focused small businesses.  We are committed to complete transparency
  of all operations and finances and a democratic governance by our work contributors and patrons.  
  We believe in fair exchanges of value, and the generation of profits for society, not shareholders.
</p>

<h2>Services</h2>
<p>
  We offer software development and integration services with a focus on transparent and non-extractive
  payment processing and e-commerce solutions.
  We also provide guidance in evaluating both your on-line and in-person transaction processing needs
  and choosing merchant services providers, retail point-of-sale systems, online payment gateways,
  and alternative payment solutions.
  We are not affiliated with any vendors and operate as an independent advocate for your organization
  in order to assist you in determining and implementing the best payment solutions and negotiating
  the best rates with ethical providers.

<h2>How We Work</h2>
<p>
  We believe that it's not possible to truly know the value of services provided before they are performed,
  so we prefer to offer our services on a non-contractual basis.  If we believe that we can add value
  to your organization and have established a level of mutual trust, then we will provide our services.
  Upon completion we will present our estimate of the value provided, but we will defer to your assessment
  of the value received, and in many cases we will happily accept barter exchanges.
